# Bowie's Brain

The Robot Missions Earth Planetary Rover 1.0 (nicknamed Bowie) uses these boards for its brain. It runs on a Teensy 3.6, and has compatibility with the 3.2 if you want to run a few servos and the motors. For more information, please see RobotMissions.org

This work is currently released open source under CC BY-SA. We will likely migrate to CERN OHL when we officially launch and support the board.
