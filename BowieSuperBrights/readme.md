# Bowie's Super Brights

This is an add-on board for the Robot Missions Earth Planetary Rover 1.0. It uses four transistors and PWM from the brain to set the brightness of the LEDs. Reminder to be careful about battery life! For more information, please see RobotMissions.org

This work is currently released open source under CC BY-SA. We will likely migrate to CERN OHL when we officially launch and support the board.
